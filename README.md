# Fish Finder

### Demo
This game can be played [here.](https://msyphus.github.io/fish-finder/)

### General
A simple memory game that passes the time and increases awareness of important vulnerable fish species.  Rockfish are a family of important commercial and game fish that are being overfished.  Several species are endangered or threatened.  They live deep so they often experience barotrauma when they are caught, which severely hinders the ability to safely release them.  They also have a long life span and slow maturity.  In short, these fish are hard-come-easy-go (they are slow to reproduce, but fast to be wiped out).  Several agencies invest a lot of money into conservation and awareness.  An important part of awareness is to educate the fishing community about species identification (and safe catch-and-release methods) so they can release the species that are most vulnerable.  This is difficult, however, since many rockfish species look alike.  This game helps improve the ability to recognize different species of rockfish.  A future version would display the species names when the fish cards are clicked.

### How To Play
To play the game, simply click on the fish pictures.  Upon click, the images will randomize.  Try to click each fish card only once.  If you click a card more than once, the game will reset.  If you successfully click all 16 cards, you win the game.  To replay, just click a card and the game will reset.
